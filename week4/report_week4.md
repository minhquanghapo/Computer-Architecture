# Report week4
### Assignment 1 : 
*Create a new project to implement the Home Assigment 1. Compile and upload to simulator. Initialize two operands (register $s1 and $s2), run this program step by step, observe memory and registers value*

** Resolve **
```
.text
li $s1,0x7fffffff #set s1 = greatest positive number 
li $s2,0x6fffffff #set s2 = positive number => result will be overflow
start:
li $t0,0 #No Overflow is default status
addu $s3,$s1,$s2 # s3 = s1 + s2
xor $t1,$s1,$s2 #Test if $s1 and $s2 have the same sign
bltz $t1,EXIT #If not, exit
slt $t2,$s3,$s1
bltz $s1,NEGATIVE #Test if $s1 and $s2 is negative?
beq $t2,$zero,EXIT #s1 and $s2 are positive
# if $s3 > $s1 then the result is not overflow
j OVERFLOW
NEGATIVE:
bne $t2,$zero,EXIT #s1 and $s2 are negative
# if $s3 < $s1 then the result is not overflow
OVERFLOW:
li $t0,1 #the result is overflow
EXIT:
```

### Assignment 2
*Write a program to do the following tasks:*

* Extract MSB of $s0 
* Clear LSB of $s0
* Set LSB of $s0 (bits 7 to 0 are set to 1)
* Clear $s0 (s0=0, must use logical instructions)
* MSB: Most Significant Byte 
* LSB: Least Significant Byte 

> s0 = 0x 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

** Resolve **
```
.text

#Extract MSB of $s0
li $s0,0x55555555
andi  $t0,$s0,0xff000000

#Clear LSB of $s0
li $s0,0x55555555
andi  $t0,$s0,0xffffff00

#set LSB to 1
li $s0,0x55555555
ori  $t0,$s0,0x000000ff

#sclear $s0
li $s0,0x55555555
andi  $t0,$s0,0
```

### Assignment 3
*Pseudo instructions in MIPS are not-directly- run-on- MIPS-
processor instructions which need to be converted to real-instructions of MIPS. Re-write the following pseudo instructions using real-instructions understood by MIPS processors:*


** Resolve **
```
#Abs
li $s1,0xfffffffe
bgtz $t0,POSITIVE
nop
xori $t1,$s1,0xffffffff
addi $s0,$t1,1
j END
#POSITIVE:
add $s0,$zero,$s1 
END:
#resutl is $s0

#Move
li $s1,1
add $s0,$zero,$s1

#Not
li $s1,1
nor $s0,$zero,$s1

#Ble
li $s1,3
li $s2,2
sgt $t0,$s1,$s2
beq $t0,$zero,L
nop
li $s3,3
#L:

```

### Assignment 4
*To dectect overflow in additional operation, we also use other rule than the one in Assignment 1. This rule is: when add two operands that have the same sign, overflow will occur if the sum doesnâ€™t have the same sign with either operands. You need to use this rule to write another overflow detection program*

** Resolve **

```
.text
li $s1,0x7fffffff #set s1 = greatest positive number 
li $s2,0x6fffffff #set s2 = positive number => result will be overflow
start:
li $t0,0 #No Overflow is default status
addu $s3,$s1,$s2 # s3 = s1 + s2
xor $t1,$s1,$s2 #Test if $s1 and $s2 have the same sign
bltz $t1,EXIT #If not, exit
xor $t2,$s3,$s1 #if $s3 and $s1 have the same sign
bgtz $t2,EXIT #if not, over flow
li $t0,1 #the result is overflow
EXIT:
```

### Assignment 5
*Write a program that implement multiply by a small power of 2. (2, 4, 8, 16, etc for example).*

** Conclusions **
*Before you pass the laboratory exercise, think about the questions below:*

* What is the difference between SLLV and SLL instructions?
* What is the difference between SRLV and SRL instructions?

```
li $s0,4
sll $t0,$s0,1
```
*SLLV -- Shift left logical variable*
> * Description: Shifts a register value left by the value in a second register and places the result in
*a third register. Zeroes are shifted in.*
> * Operation: $d = $t << $s; advance_pc (4);
Syntax: sllv $d, $t, $s

*SLL -- Shift left logical*
> * Description: Shifts a register value left by the shift amount listed in the instruction and places
the result in a third register. Zeroes are shifted in.
> * Operation: $d = $t << h; advance_pc (4);
Syntax: sll $d, $t, h
